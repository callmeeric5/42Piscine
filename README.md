# 42Piscine

This repo is about the piscine in 42 Paris from 26/01 to 20/02. As requested by some friends, I upload subjects and solutions of all modules.

## Before Start

✅ **Complete Modules**: Includes all modules;

✅ **Validated**: All solutions passed moulinette;

❌ No exams/rushes;

❌ After several failures of the moulinette, I lost my patience or even burnt out on some exercises. Those solutions might not be elegant or readable.

## How to use

* For the pisciners around me, if you ran out of your time during the piscine and want to complete it, feel free to pick up where you ended by exploring this repo.
  
* For people who are interested in 42 and want to do some preparations before it starts, these modules will give you a clear roadmap of what to expect.
  
* For current pisciners, use these solutions as a reference or a hint when you are stuck but **please do not just copy paste.** 


Thanks for your reading and take whatever you need! If you find it helps you somehow, please give it a star.
